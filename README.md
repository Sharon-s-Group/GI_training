# GI_training
In Ghost Imaging (GI), we illuminate an object with a series of non-uniform light patterns, known as references (each pattern is distinct). 
By correlating these reference patterns with the corresponding total intensities measured after the object, referred to as tests, we can reconstruct the image of the object.

Below, you can find basic GI exercises and their solutions.
